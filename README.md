# poetry-generation

This project was created as a term paper. The topic of the course work is "poetry generation using NLP tools". What can be found here?

## dataset

the dataset folder contains data containing all the works of the 5 poets I am considering: Pushkin, Yesenin, Blok, Tyutchev and Mayakovsky. For high-quality training (additional training of models), the data was processed and cut into small pieces and collected in dataset.pkl

## models

In the model folder you can find the code for training the models I uploaded at https://huggingface.co/AnyaSchen. You can find each model by reference.

Quick access to models is standard for models from Hugging face:
